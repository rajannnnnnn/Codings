A personal assistant capable of getting voice commands and automating basic windows tasks.

This was my very beginning mini project, as i wanted to make python language familiar. This is tailored only for my needs and may suit to no one else. Anyway I am not using it nowadays.

It is complex programming rather than efficient programming, so I remember nothing more about that.
